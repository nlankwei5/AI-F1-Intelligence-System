# AI-F1-Intelligence-System (ApexFlow)

This is an AI-driven telemetry and analytics backend inspired by Formula 1 race intelligence systems.
It ingests, processes, and analyzes high-frequency data streams in real time — and delivers both technical and business insights through Grafana and Power BI dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview
It  provides a unified platform for:

- Real-time data ingestion from live or simulated F1 telemetry (via FastF1)

- Stream and asynchronous processing using Celery and Faust

- AI-powered analytics for performance insights using OpenAI

- Dual visualization for both engineers (Grafana) and executives (Power BI)

This project uses Formula 1 data as a prototype, but the architecture is industry-agnostic, designed to scale into finance, logistics, energy, or manufacturing telemetry systems.
